# ascbot

ascbot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot].

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he
has, etc!

### Running ascbot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start ascbot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    ascbot>

Then you can interact with ascbot by typing `ascbot help`.

    ascbot> ascbot help
    ascbot 8ball <query> - Consults the magic eight-ball for your question.
    ascbot help - Displays all of the help commands that ascbot knows about.
    ...

### Configuration

A few scripts (including some installed by default) require environment
variables to be set as a simple form of configuration.

How to set environment variables will be specific to your operating system.
Rather than recreate the various methods and best practices in achieving this,
it's suggested that you search for a dedicated guide focused on your OS.


### Scripting

An example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to
get started, along with the [Scripting Guide](scripting-docs).

For many common tasks, there's a good chance someone has already one to do just
the thing.

### external-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead of
writing it yourself, you can use existing plugins.

Hubot is able to load plugins from third-party `npm` packages. This is the
recommended way to add functionality to your hubot. You can get a list of
available hubot plugins on [npmjs.com](npmjs) or by using `npm search`:

    % npm search hubot-scripts panda
    NAME             DESCRIPTION                        AUTHOR DATE       VERSION KEYWORDS
    hubot-pandapanda a hubot script for panda responses =missu 2014-11-30 0.9.2   hubot hubot-scripts panda
    ...


To use a package, check the package's documentation, but in general it is:

1. Use `npm install --save` to add the package to `package.json` and install it
2. Add the package name to `external-scripts.json` as a double quoted string

You can review `external-scripts.json` to see what is included by default.


##  Persistence

ascbot uses a flat json file for the data storage of the hubot-brain. This
file is expected to be stored in the `/srv` directory in the docker
container. In order to set this path the `HUBOT_BRAIN_DIR` must be set to the
`/srv` path. This path should then be bound to a volume on the docker host in
order to ensure the data survives further deployments of ascbot.


## Adapters

ascbot is expected to be deployed to a slack workspace. You can then run hubot
with the adapter.

    % bin/hubot -a slack


## Deployment

ascbot includes a `Dockerfile` for building a docker image able to run it.
This image can then be used to run a docker container to complete the
deployment. A local volume for the should be bound to the `/srv` path in order
to ensure that the `hubot-brain.json` file has persistant storage. A slack
"Bot User OAuth Access Token" needs to be passed as an environment variable in
order to enable ascbot to connect to the slack workspace.

    % sudo docker build -t myuser/ascbot .
    % git push heroku master
    % sudo docker run -d \
          --name ascbot \
          -e HUBOT_BRAIN_DIR=/srv \
          -e HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-<your-token> \
          --volume "/local/docker/ascbot/config:/srv" \
          myuser/ascbot
